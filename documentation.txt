This implementation of pass 1 I use initially thought to use a linked list implementation but I ended up using an Array of pointers. Furthermore I 
used your 2 functions for add to symbol and check symbol table by allocating size of symbol to the newsy variable. Then use the pointer 
notation to store the address and string copy the name into the index of the struct. Then using a loop to check if the table has iterate to a new 
index and then store symbol newsym into table. The location counter was handled by a number of string compare else if statements that 
appropriate add to the counter.

I do believe everything is complete and potentially since I was not sure of what the appropriate outputs for the Location counter, I am sure if that’s 
while loop handled all the directives appropriately. If anything for the next pass I’d like to change those else if statements to a different function so 
that I can have a cleaner main function for later. Lastly, I also had problems freeing my allocated memory. From my overview, I believed my 
issue to be that since I did not have temporary variables to “ strtok “ into, those index’s of memory had been distorted ( newsymMem = newsym = 
strtok(NULL, “ /t/n/r);  ). I will try to fix these pointers if this is in fact the problem.
